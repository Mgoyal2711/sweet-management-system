## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14 or higher)
* `npm` (comes with Node.js)
* (Optional but recommended) [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Live Server extension for frontend development.

### 1. ⚙️ Backend Setup (API Server)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Mgoyal2711/Sweet-management-system](https://github.com/Mgoyal2711/Sweet-management-system)
    ```
2.  **Navigate and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd Sweet-management-system/Backend
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    > 🌐 The API server will be running at: **`http://localhost:3000`**

### 2. 🎨 Frontend Setup (UI)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../Frontend
    ```
2.  **Launch the UI:**
    * **Option A (Recommended):** Use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code to open `index.html`.
    * **Option B:** Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

> 💡 **NOTE:** Ensure the backend server is running on port 3000 before interacting with the frontend.
